			<h1>Hey there!</h2>
			<p id="about">Hey there my name is Linda! I'm currently practicing my chops in UX design, but I also have a background in photography and videography.  Currently in my second last semester at  Simon Fraser's <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html">School of Interactive Arts + Technology</a> (SIAT).
			<br><br>
			My head's usually in the clouds thinking about something. Currently it's been thinking about how we designers not only create products, but should have the ability to critically think about the social ramifications that may exist in our products and inventions. Issues like privacy, human rights, and equality are being translated through the digital products that we use and create everyday and don't neccesarily consider or even think about.
