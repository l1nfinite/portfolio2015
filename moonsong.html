					<h3>Brief</h3>


						<p> This was an individual based project for a upper level film course. The only criteria we had to fulfill was to use somehow use chroma keying in our final film. I chose to do film a cover of my friend doing "The Moon Song" as seem in the Film <em>Her.</em> I personally loved both the film and song, and so I wanted to see what I could create. </p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
						<p>Below are some various story boards that I drafted up to try and convey what I wanted to capture. These iterations changed when I began filming and realized that I wasn't able to capture what I had intended.  </p>

					<p> I had also did a lot of of testing beforehand to play with concepts that I haden't really played with yet. For example I had never really played with 60 fps, and this was the result when I was playing around with it.

					<p>During post production I had slight difficulties matching the forrest scenes with the studio scenes. I use techniques such as matching the graphic elements to make it flow better. </p>
